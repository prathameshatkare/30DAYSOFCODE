# Array Problem List

## Problem 1: [Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtract-the-product-and-sum-of-digits-of-an-integer/) ✅

### Description:
Given an integer number `n`, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

### Example:
#### Input:
```
n = 234
```
#### Output:
```
15
```

### Explanation:
- Product of digits = `2 * 3 * 4 = 24`
- Sum of digits = `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`
- Difference = `24 - 9 = 15`

### Solution:
This problem has been solved successfully. The approach involves iterating through the digits of the number, calculating their product and sum, and finally returning the difference.

## Problem 2: [Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/) ❌

### Description:
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of `1` bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Example:
#### Input:
```
n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
```
#### Output:
```
3
```

### Explanation:
The binary representation of `11` has `3` `1`s.

#### Constraints:
- The input must be treated as an unsigned integer.
- For C++/Java users, the input can be a string of `32` bits.
